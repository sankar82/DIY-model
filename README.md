# DIY-model
Build a deployable frontend application for a ML model (regression or classification)
I am working with the Pima Indian diabetics dataset to predict the outcome of the disease. 
I will be running various classification models such as RAndomForest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, KNN etc
Then I plan to deploy the model using Streamlit
